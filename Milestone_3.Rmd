## Korean Diaspora in the U.S.: The reasons and patterns of the Korean migration

For my project, I wanted to explore why there were such a large body of Korean immigrants in the U.S. and their motivations for emigrating to such a different place. I wanted to explore which specific geographical regions they went to, which possible correlations I could find with the job market and industry with these various locations,and any other possible reasons why the South Korean people would want to move to the U.S. 

I have found several different sources to explore for this project:

# The Korean Statistical Information Service

I was able to find a few excel sheets of several different parts of the Korean immigration system; due to some difficulty in data collection, the latest data I could find was of the 2017 surveys for both Long term emmigration from Korea and the overall numbers of people migrating to and from Korea.

This link specifically is for overall statistics of people that left and came into korea in 2017:
